"""
Graph algorithms for control flow and program analysis.

This package provides fundamental graph algorithms used throughout pyflow for
analyzing control flow graphs and other directed graph structures. The algorithms
support various program analysis tasks including:

- Basic graph operations (reversal, entry point finding)
- Graph coloring for resource allocation
- Dominator analysis for control flow
- DJ (Dominator-Joint) graph construction
- Exclusion graph analysis for mutual exclusivity
- Merge serialization for SSA form transformations

These algorithms are used in control flow analysis, data flow analysis, and
various optimization passes.
